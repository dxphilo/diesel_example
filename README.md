## Introduction
In this guide, we cover the process of interacting with a PostgreSQL database in Rust. You will learn how to:
- Set up a PostgreSQL database
- Use Diesel for database migrations and schema management
- Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Automate database interaction through functions

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- PostgreSQL
- Rustup and Cargo
- Diesel CLI (`cargo install diesel_cli`)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diesel_example
   cd your-project-directory
   ```
## Set up the database:


```
diesel setup
```
## Run migrations:

```
diesel migration run
```
## CRUD Operations

- Create: Inserting records into the database
- Read: Fetching records from the database
- Update: Modifying existing records
- Delete: Removing records from the database

Check out the individual code files in the src/ directory for detailed implementations of each CRUD operation.

### Running the Project
To run the project, use the following command:

```
cargo run
```
Follow along with the article to see the full explanations of the code and examples of database interaction.

This README file provides an outline and helps users get started with the project and understand its context related to the article.
